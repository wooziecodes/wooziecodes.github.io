                <h4>Financial Literacy AI for Migrant Workers</h4>
                <div class="project-meta">The Reach Alliance | July 2024 — Present</div>
                <p>I lead research and prototype development exploring how conversational AI and large language models can enhance financial literacy for migrant workers in Singapore. The project investigates how multilingual dialogue systems can provide culturally responsive financial education in contexts where language barriers and unfamiliar institutional systems create barriers to economic participation.</p>

                <p><strong>Research questions:</strong> How can AI chatbots explain financial concepts across languages and cultural frameworks for money management? What trust mechanisms matter in AI-mediated learning? How do we design systems that account for varying levels of digital and financial literacy?</p>

                <p><strong>Methods & Tools:</strong> Natural Language Processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, OpenAI APIs, user-centered design research. Developing tailored AI agents for contextual Q&A and guided financial education, collaborating with a multidisciplinary team on interfaces aligned with SDGs 8 (Decent Work), 9 (Industry & Innovation), and 11 (Sustainable Cities).</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h4>OTR Copilot: AI-Augmented System for Digital Emotional Support</h4>
                <div class="project-meta">Over The Rainbow (OTR) | INTS402 Capstone Project | January 2025 — May 2025</div>
                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Youth well-being mentors at Over The Rainbow reported spending "considerably more time" interpreting digital emotional expressions compared to face-to-face interactions. Traditional emotional intelligence frameworks fail to account for Singapore's unique linguistic landscape—code-switching, Colloquial Singapore English (CSE) patterns like sentence-final particles ("sia"), emoji usage, and asynchronous timing signals that carry emotional weight in youth support conversations.</p>

                <p><strong>My Approach:</strong> I led the end-to-end development of an AI copilot system, from discovery research through technical implementation and user testing. The project demonstrates product thinking grounded in interdisciplinary depth: user interviews surfaced pain points, strategic scoping balanced technical feasibility against impact, and implementation decisions (Singapore English NLP adaptations, augmentation-vs-automation philosophy, ethical safeguards) emerged from a CIS-informed understanding that technology must honor—not flatten—cultural and emotional complexity.</p>

                <p><strong>What I Built:</strong> A Flutter-based copilot with four core capabilities: (1) digital expression pattern recognition analyzing emoji usage, message timing, and linguistic shifts; (2) context-aware analysis with baseline tracking to detect emotional deviations; (3) LLM-powered message templates that preserve mentor authenticity; (4) resource recommendations integrated with OTR's knowledge base. The system incorporates custom NLP adaptations for CSE emotional markers, cultural-linguistic patterns, and privacy-first architecture.</p>

                <p><strong>Validation & Impact:</strong> Testing with 5 OTR mentors showed 65% improvement in interpretation accuracy, with mentors rating the system 3.4/5 overall. User feedback validated core hypotheses about augmentation (AI enhances, doesn't replace human judgment) and workflow integration (effectiveness depends on seamless embedding, not disruption). The meta-analysis feature—surfacing emotional patterns across conversations—emerged as uniquely valuable, leveraging AI's computational strengths while preserving the relational core of peer support.</p>

                <p><strong>Strategic Decisions:</strong> Scoped as standalone MVP (not full OTR platform integration) to balance capstone timeline constraints. Prioritized foundational UX and cognitive load management over advanced ML features. Used synthetic conversation data to maintain privacy/ethics. Chose rule-based approaches over complex models to ensure interpretability in emotionally sensitive contexts.</p>

                <p><strong>Technical Stack:</strong> Flutter (cross-platform UI), Firebase (auth, Firestore, serverless functions), Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (context-aware message generation), custom NLP with Singapore English adaptations, cultural emoji interpretation algorithms.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflections:</strong> This project bridges my Information Systems technical foundation with CIS's holistic lens. Every technical decision—from prompt engineering for culturally-grounded message templates to balancing real-time responsiveness with analysis depth—reflected an interdisciplinary understanding that effective AI assistance must account for trust formation, cultural context, and the delicate human work it aims to support. Three complete redesigns taught me that messy iteration is where real product thinking happens.</p>
