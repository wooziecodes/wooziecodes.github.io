  <h1>Determined and the Death of Deserving</h1>
  <p><em>On meritocracy, free will, and the quiet grief of being human</em></p>

  <p>
    Robert Sapolsky's <strong><em>Determined</em></strong> hit me like a diagnosis I'd been avoiding. Here's a Stanford neurobiologist—not some armchair philosopher—methodically dismantling the last sacred cow: that somewhere, somehow, we're the authors of our own actions. That the "I" who decides is more than neurons firing in patterns set by forces beyond our control.
  </p>

  <p>
    I should have been ready for this. Growing up in Singapore, you breathe meritocracy like humidity—it's just there, shaping everything. Study harder. Sleep less. If you fail, look in the mirror. The system works because we believe we're the variable. But what if we're not? What if the mirror shows a machine running code it didn't write?
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's where Sapolsky gets uncomfortable: he's not interested in making you feel better about this. He's a scientist with a scalpel, and the patient is our most cherished delusion. Page after page of evidence—from split-brain studies to the neuroscience of decision-making—all pointing to the same conclusion. That feeling of choosing? It's the brain's post-hoc narrative, a story we tell ourselves milliseconds after the decision has already been made in regions we can't access.
  </p>

  <p>
    The book stumbles when it dismisses centuries of philosophical work on compatibilism in a few breezy paragraphs. Sapolsky's impatience with philosophy feels like a surgeon annoyed by poetry—sure, but you're operating on human meaning here, not just tissue.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    And yet. There's something liberating in the wreckage. If nobody truly "deserves" their advantages or failures—if we're all just different recordings of chance and circumstance—then maybe the whole scorecard was wrong from the start.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I keep thinking about my younger self, grinding through another all-nighter, convinced that exhaustion was the price of worthiness. What would I tell her now? That her drive wasn't her choice? That the shame she felt for not being "enough" was just another output of a system she didn't design?
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe that's too much. Maybe it's exactly enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sapolsky isn't peddling nihilism—he's clearing ground. Once you stop believing in the ghost in the machine, you can start seeing the actual machinery. And maybe, just maybe, you can be a little kinder to it. To yourself. To everyone else struggling with their own programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Determined</em> won't give you answers. But if you've ever wondered why trying harder doesn't always work, why some people seem to glide while others grind, why the voice in your head sounds so certain about choices you might not have made—this book will show you the wiring diagram. What you do with that knowledge? Well, that's the paradox, isn't it?
