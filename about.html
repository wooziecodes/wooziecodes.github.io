            <h3>Research Interests</h3>
            <p>I build and study technologies that mediate emotional, economic, and cognitive life — particularly in multilingual and cross-cultural contexts. My work explores how intelligent systems can extend human capability rather than replace it, and what that means for design ethics in contexts where language, culture, and power shape access.</p>

            <p>Recent projects include AI-driven emotion recognition systems for youth mental health support, multilingual dialogue agents for migrant financial literacy, and investigations into how conversational AI mediates trust and understanding across linguistic barriers. I study how people and institutions adapt when intelligence becomes ambient — when machines begin to shape learning, work, and emotional life.</p>

            <p>My current research asks: How can we build context-aware, culturally responsive technologies that support human flourishing in an age of ambient intelligence? What ethical frameworks should govern systems that mediate such fundamental aspects of human experience?</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I studied Information Systems at Singapore Management University and spent a semester at University College London. My path has been varied — from co-founding a mental health tech startup, to researching conversational AI for development policy. I work across English, Mandarin, and French, which has shaped how I think about language as infrastructure for access and understanding.</p>

            <p>I've lived and worked in Singapore, Beijing, and London, experiences that informed my interest in how digital systems shape economic participation and knowledge access across cultural contexts. This cross-cultural lens runs through my technical work, from building multilingual AI systems to studying how postcolonial innovation ecosystems adapt emerging technologies.</p>

            <h3>Current Focus</h3>
            <p>I currently work in international trade and investment, focusing on Singapore-Middle East market development. I continue research with the <a href="https://reachalliance.org/" target="_blank">Reach Alliance</a> on using conversational AI to enhance financial literacy for migrant workers, and worked as a Product & Systems Developer at <a href="https://otrlistens.net/" target="_blank">Over The Rainbow</a>, building emotion pattern recognition systems for youth well-being support.</p>
