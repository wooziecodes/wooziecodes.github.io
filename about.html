        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Arif Woozeer, a Singaporean and former Mauritian with a passion for merging technology and behavioral science to make a positive impact.  I'm the co-founder of Kura Kura and a student of Information Systems & Affective Technologies at Singapore Management University.</p>
    </p>
        
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>My journey has been a mix of tech, entrepreneurship, and public service. I've gone from being a Ground Response Officer with the Singapore Police Force to diving into the startup world. Along the way, I've picked up skills in front-end development, data analysis, and product management. I'm always up for learning something new, whether it's through academic pursuits or hands-on experience.</p>
        
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and human behavior. When I'm not coding or brainstorming ideas, you'll find me at the gym, nose-deep in a book, or trying to keep my Duolingo streak alive. I'm also keen on understanding China's role in the global tech scene and have been involved with the Business China Youth Chapter to bridge cultural and business gaps.</p>
        
        <h3>Connect With Me</h3>
        <p>If you're interested in tech, startups, or just want to chat about the latest book you've read, I'd love to connect! Feel free to explore my projects and blog, or reach out directly. Let's learn from each other!</p>
