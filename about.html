        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there! I'm Arif Woozeer, and I'm passionate about gamifying emotions and exploring the intersection of computing and affective technology. Currently, I'm co-founding Kura Kura while studying Computing & Affective Tech at Singapore Management University (SMU).</p>
        
        <h3>My Background</h3>
        <p>My journey has been a mix of tech, entrepreneurship, and public service. I've gone from being a Ground Response Officer with the Singapore Police Force to diving into the startup world with Kura Kura. Along the way, I've developed skills in React Native, front-end development, data analysis, and project management. I'm always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve real-world problems.</p>
        
        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>I'm fascinated by the potential of technology to positively impact lives, especially at the intersection of tech and behavioral science. When I'm not coding or brainstorming ideas, you'll find me at the gym, reading, or trying to keep my Duolingo streak alive. I'm also keen on fostering youth entrepreneurship and have been actively involved in organizing events and competitions to support this cause.</p>
        
        <h3>Connect With Me</h3>
        <p>If you're interested in tech startups, affective computing, or just want to chat about innovative ideas, I'd love to connect! Feel free to explore my projects and work experiences, or reach out directly. Let's learn from each other and maybe even collaborate on something exciting!</p>
