            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Arif Woozeer. I'm studying Computing & Affective Technology at Singapore Management University (SMU) and co-founding a startup called Kura Kura. My journey's been pretty varied - I started as a Ground Response Officer with the Singapore Police Force before jumping into the startup world. Along the way, I've picked up skills in React Native, front-end development, data analysis, and project management.</p>

            <h3>Interests & Pursuits</h3>
            <p>I'm really into how we can use technology to understand and work with human emotions, especially in gaming. Some areas I'm exploring include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Affective computing and its real-world applications</li>
                <li>Using emotional AI in gaming and education</li>
                <li>How technology can make our experiences better</li>
                <li>The ethics of systems that can detect and respond to emotions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I'm also fascinated by how technology and behavioral science can work together to improve lives.</p>

            <h3>Current Focus</h3>
            <p>Right now, I'm juggling my studies with running Kura Kura. I'm also:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Doing research with the Reach Alliance on innovative solutions to global challenges</li>
                <li>Digging deeper into affective technologies through my SMU coursework</li>
                <li>Working as a peer listener with OTR Listens, providing empathetic support to those who need it</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cultural Experiences and Language Learning</h3>
            <p>I love interacting with different cultures and languages. I've had the chance to work in Beijing, China, which was an amazing experience that broadened my perspective. Currently, I'm working towards my A2 French certification. Learning languages isn't just about communication for me - it's a window into different ways of thinking and living.</p>

            <h3>Beyond Work</h3>
            <p>When I'm not buried in code or brainstorming new ideas, you might find me at the gym, reading a good book, or trying to keep my Duolingo streak alive. I'm always up for learning something new and meeting people with similar interests.</p>
            <p>If you're into tech startups, affective computing, or just want to chat about new ideas, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to connect, share experiences, and maybe even collaborate on something cool.</p>
