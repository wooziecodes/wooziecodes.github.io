                <p>Last week, I moderated a panel on hustle culture, overwork, and burnout at LIT DISCOvery 2022. Four incredible panelists—Caleb Tan, Emmeline Lim, Nur Haziqah Amellia, and Ziying Wang—shared their experiences and perspectives with a room full of young people trying to figure out how to build meaningful lives without destroying themselves in the process.</p>

                <p>I came into that conversation with my own complicated history with hustle culture. For years, I wore busyness like a badge of honor. I measured my worth in productivity metrics—the number of projects I was juggling, the hours I was logging, the sleep I was sacrificing. I thought that was what ambition looked like.</p>

                <p>It took hitting a wall to realize I'd been confusing motion with meaning.</p>

                <p>What struck me most about our conversation wasn't the answers we arrived at—it was the questions that refused to resolve neatly. The panelists brought such different perspectives, shaped by different industries, different pressures, different definitions of success. And listening to them, I realized how much of the hustle culture conversation exists in uncomfortable gray zones.</p>

                <p>Questions like: How do you distinguish between passion that energizes and obsession that depletes? When does "doing what you love" become an excuse for exploitation, of yourself or others? How do you set boundaries in a culture that treats boundaries as lack of commitment?</p>

                <p>And perhaps the hardest one: How do you reconcile the very real structural pressures (cost of living, competitive job market, expectations of family and society) with the need to protect your wellbeing?</p>

                <p>I don't think anyone on that panel pretended to have these figured out. That honesty felt important.</p>

                    <figcaption>The conversation that mattered most happened in the questions, not the answers.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>One moment that stayed with me: a question from the audience about how to talk to parents who grew up in different economic circumstances, who see rest as laziness and self-care as selfishness. The generational dimension of hustle culture doesn't get discussed enough. Our parents' generation often worked punishing hours because they had to—survival demanded it. How do we honor that sacrifice while also acknowledging that we might need to build something different?</p>

                <p>I left LIT DISCOvery with more questions than when I arrived. I'm still sitting with them.</p>

                <p>What does sustainable ambition actually look like? How do we build systems—workplaces, communities, cultures—that don't require people to burn out to prove their worth? And how do we hold space for the complexity that some people find genuine meaning in intense work, while others are using busyness to avoid confronting harder questions about what they actually want?</p>

                <p>I don't have clean conclusions to offer. But I'm increasingly convinced that the willingness to sit with these questions, to resist the urge to optimize our way to easy answers, might be exactly what we need.</p>

                <p>Thank you to the LIT DISCOvery team and NTUC Youth for creating space for this conversation. And to Caleb, Emmeline, Haziqah, and Ziying for being so honest and open on the panel.</p>

                <p>The questions continue.</p>
