                <p>Will picked me up in San Mateo on a gray morning. We'd met almost two years ago in a Prague hostel—one of those brief encounters that somehow sticks. We'd kept in touch across continents, and now here we were, driving west toward the Pacific without much of a plan beyond entering the ocean together.</p>

                <p>The drive to Half Moon Bay takes you through rolling hills that feel impossibly green for California. Will talked about work, about the particular exhaustion of building things in tech, about how hard it is to maintain friendships as an adult when everyone's scattered and busy and performing wellness on Instagram instead of actually checking in.</p>

                <p>I mostly listened. Sometimes that's the gift you can give.</p>

                <p>At the beach, Will moved through the water with practiced grace while I spent most of my time flailing. I didn't catch a single wave worth mentioning. But there was something in the surrender of it—the Pacific's vastness, the cold shock, the comfort of company that doesn't demand performance.</p>

                <p>An older surfer named Tom paddled over at one point. He'd been watching me struggle and offered some advice about positioning. Then he said something that stayed with me: "You don't get to control the sea, just how you show up in it."</p>

                <p>I've been thinking about that ever since.</p>

                <p>Driving back to San Mateo, I watched the landscape shift. Waymo vehicles gliding silently through intersections. Billboards advertising AI solutions that promise to optimize every aspect of human existence. Venture capital firms with names that sound like wellness retreats. The whole apparatus of Silicon Valley, humming along, convinced that the right algorithm can debug any problem.</p>

                <p>It's a strange place to process feelings. The culture here is so oriented toward engineering solutions, toward moving fast and breaking things, toward the next pivot or product launch. The language is all optimization and iteration and scale.</p>

                <p>But the real debugging happened in the water. In the car conversations about whether we're doing any of this right. In Will admitting he doesn't have it figured out either. In the unplanned hours that don't produce anything measurable.</p>

                <p>People come to the West Coast looking for reinvention. I get it. There's something seductive about the promise of starting fresh, of becoming someone new against a backdrop of ocean sunsets and startup mythology.</p>

                <p>But I'm not sure reinvention is what I needed. What I needed was someone who remembered who I was in Prague and still wanted to spend a gray Tuesday failing at surfing together. Someone who knew my accumulated history and showed up anyway.</p>

                <p>You don't get to control the sea. Just how you show up in it.</p>

                <p>I showed up flailing. And somehow, that was enough.</p>
