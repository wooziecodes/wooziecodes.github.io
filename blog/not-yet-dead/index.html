    <h1>Not Yet Dead: What REACH Taught Me About the Violence of Optimization</h1>

    <p class="meta">December 7, 2025</p>

    <h2>The Conference That Wasn't Really About Research</h2>

    <p>Last month our team present a years of work at the REACH Alliance 2025 conference in Singapore. Polished deck, choreographed demo, spotlight session on financial literacy chatbots for migrant workers. The academic performance executed flawlessly at SMU.</p>

    <p>But what I actually remember isn't the presentation. It's afterward, when a group of us REACH participants went out for ice cream.</p>

    <p>We were coming down the stairs - this impossibly diverse group that made no institutional sense - and people were staring. Trying to figure us out. You could see the confusion on their faces, the failed attempts at categorization.</p>

    <p>We weren't just demographically diverse. One team had researchers from UCL working with Indigenous communities in Canada. Another had students from Toronto studying healthcare access in remote villages. Our team: Selvan, a long-term migrant worker who's been in Singapore over a decade. Caroline, information systems background with years in migrant worker advocacy. Me, Mauritian who studied across Singapore, Beijing, London, now at Enterprise Singapore while prepping for law school.</p>

    <p>We had fundamentally different relationships to the work - lived experience, academic training, policy implementation, community organizing all colliding. People kept trying to place us. "So which university...?" "Are you all from...?" We didn't fit the boxes.</p>

    <p>That confusion, that inability to categorize us, felt more honest than the spotlight validation. Because REACH's work is precisely about refusing the categories that make marginalization legible and therefore acceptable.</p>

    <p>The real value of the conference: finding people who understand that "70% coverage achieved" means 30% are still excluded. People who know the work isn't optimizing delivery - it's interrogating the systems that create "hard to reach" populations in the first place.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Victorian Logic: A Phrase That Changed Everything</h2>

    <p>Before I get to what Joe Wong's speech revealed, I need you to understand one phrase. It's from the 1850s but it explains everything about how we still operate today.</p>

    <p>The phrase comes from "The Ghost Map," Steven Johnson's book about London's 1854 cholera outbreak. During the epidemic, this is how Victorian society described poor victims in marginalized neighborhoods:</p>

    <p><strong>"Joe lives, which is to say, he has not yet died."</strong></p>

    <p>Read it again slowly. Notice three things:</p>

    <h3>First: It starts with hope, ends with fatalism</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>"Joe lives!" sounds optimistic - he's alive, active voice, suggesting vitality</li>
        <li>But then: "which is to say" - translation marker, about to correct your understanding</li>
        <li>Final blow: "he has not yet died" - passive construction, defines existence purely by what hasn't happened yet</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It's a linguistic bait-and-switch. Opens with life, immediately redefines it as temporary absence of death.</p>

    <h3>Second: The "yet" does violence</h3>

    <p>"Not yet died" means death is:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Expected</li>
        <li>Inevitable</li>
        <li>Already factored in</li>
        <li>Just delayed, not prevented</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This wasn't medical notation. It was how society conceptualized the poor's existence. The "yet" tells you everything - Joe's death is coming, we're just marking time until it arrives.</p>

    <h3>Third: The passive voice removes responsibility</h3>

    <p>Not "we are keeping him alive" or "society is supporting his health."</p>

    <p>Just: "he has not yet died"</p>

    <p>Two things this accomplishes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Removes Joe's agency (he's not actively living, just passively "not dead yet")</li>
        <li>Removes society's responsibility (death will come "naturally" - as if poverty and cholera are natural forces rather than systemic failures)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>This phrase describes a system where keeping people biologically functional is considered success. Everything else - dignity, agency, dreams, rest, belonging - gets erased.</strong></p>

    <p>Victorian London used this logic to avoid addressing sanitation, housing, poverty. Keep the poor "not yet dead" while extracting their labor. When they die (and the "yet" tells you they will), well, we never promised they'd live forever.</p>

    <h3>Why This Matters Now</h3>

    <p>Joe Wong, REACH Alliance's founder, opened the Singapore conference with this phrase. His claim: <strong>We still think this way in 2025.</strong></p>

    <p>We've just updated the vocabulary:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"70% vaccination coverage achieved" (the other 30%: not yet dead, but expected to be)</li>
        <li>"Extreme poverty reduced by 50%" (the remaining 50%: alive, which is to say not yet dead)</li>
        <li>"Under-5 mortality declining" (still measuring children by death rates, not flourishing)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Modern development has sophisticated language. But we're still measuring absence of death rather than presence of life.</p>

    <p>And once you see this logic, you see it everywhere - including in our chatbot's first version.</p>

    <h2>What Gets Erased: The No Ground Truth Problem</h2>

    <p>Our chatbot initially told a construction worker earning $600/month, sending $300 home: "Save $50 this month."</p>

    <p>His response: "After remittances, food, transport - I don't even have that much left. It makes no sense."</p>

    <p>He was right. But here's the deeper problem we discovered: <strong>There is no ground truth in financial advice.</strong></p>

    <p>Consider this scenario: Should a worker reduce remittances to pay off recruitment debt faster?</p>

    <p><strong>Answer A:</strong> Yes - mathematically optimal. Reduces 15% interest burden, accelerates debt freedom, improves long-term financial position.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer B:</strong> No - maintains family trust. Remittances support sick parents, children's education, siblings' livelihoods. They're the entire reason for migration. Break that obligation, you break your social safety net.</p>

    <p>Both answers are valid. Both have human costs. One optimizes financial metrics. The other preserves relational infrastructure that workers' entire lives depend on.</p>

    <p>With factual questions, you can verify AI: "What's the capital of France?" has a ground truth. But "Should I prioritize debt repayment over family obligations?" - there's no algorithmic answer. Only trade-offs embedded in power structures, cultural contexts, and systems that were never designed for collectivist financial realities.</p>

    <p>The chatbot was designed for "Joe lives" (economically active, earning income). But it ignored "which is to say he has not yet died":</p>

    <ul>
        <li>$7,000-$15,000 recruitment debt trapping workers in bondage</li>
        <li>11-hour workdays, 1-2 rest days monthly</li>
        <li>Remittances as moral obligation, not discretionary spending</li>
        <li>Segregated dormitories, social isolation, "temporary" status after years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Generic financial advice assumes individual decision-making, retirement planning, discretionary budgets. Western frameworks like the 50/30/20 rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings) are literally impossible when 50% goes to remittances before you start.</p>

    <p>It's optimized for people who already have conditions to live, not people in "not yet dead" status.</p>

    <h2>The Trust Problem Is a Systems Problem</h2>

    <p>Joe shared the Indigenous vaccine story that crystallized everything.</p>

    <p>Operation Remote Immunity: delivering COVID vaccines to Northern Ontario Indigenous communities 200+ kilometers beyond where roads end. In winter you can use ice roads. Otherwise, you fly.</p>

    <p>REACH Alliance assumed this was logistics optimization. Flight schedules. Supply chains. Cold storage. Coverage percentages.</p>

    <p>What actually determined success: Whether vaccines were delivered by Indigenous physicians.</p>

    <p>Why? Residential schools where children were forcibly removed and abused. Forced sterilizations of Indigenous women. Medical experimentation without consent. Generations of colonial medical violence.</p>

    <p>Communities had every rational reason to tell southern doctors: "You want to inject us with something? We've heard that before."</p>

    <p><strong>The single most important variable wasn't logistics. It was trust.</strong></p>

    <p>Joe analyzed 70 REACH Alliance case studies. This pattern held across all of them: Trust determines success more than technology, more than efficiency, more than coverage metrics.</p>

    <p>You can't engineer trust. You can't optimize your way past historical trauma. You definitely can't deliver your way to solidarity.</p>

    <p>For our chatbot, this meant: proper language support (not romanized shortcuts), understanding context before advice (dreams before budgets), respecting debt and remittances as non-negotiable realities. We didn't rush to solutions - we took time to understand.</p>

    <p>But here's Selvan's question that still haunts me: "Will this exist after research ends?"</p>

    <h2>The Language Asymmetry We Almost Missed</h2>

    <p>We built the system assuming translation was bidirectional: workers type mixed language, bot responds in mixed language.</p>

    <p>Workers typing "ami taka save korbo" - mixing Bengali and English because romanized text is faster on phone keyboards. We mirrored that style. Workers felt uncomfortable.</p>

    <p>What they actually wanted: TYPE mixed (fast, convenient). READ in proper script (respectful).</p>

    <p>One told us: "When I type, I mix because it's fast. But when I read about my money, I want to see my language properly. It feels more respectful."</p>

    <p>Here's what matters: Even if we'd had access to the best South Asian language model - Sarvam-1, perfect Bengali processing - we would never have discovered that asymmetry without co-creation.</p>

    <p>The technology question was "Can we handle mixed language input?"</p>

    <p>The human question was "Should the response mirror the input?"</p>

    <p>We'd been optimizing a technical problem - bidirectional translation - when the real issue was understanding that input and output serve different psychological needs.</p>

    <p>Fast typing for convenience doesn't mean you want fast, casual responses about your family's financial future. Money is personal. It deserves dignity. Proper script signals: "This matters. You matter. Your language and culture matter."</p>

    <p>The solution wasn't a better model. It was a simple flow change: accept mixed input, respond in proper script.</p>

    <p>That came from listening, not engineering.</p>

    <p>This is "not yet dead" versus "truly living" in language design:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>"Not yet dead":</strong> Efficiency maximization, get message across</li>
        <li><strong>"Truly living":</strong> Dignity preservation, proper respect</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We chose dignity.</p>

    <h2>Democracy Is Fragile Because Development Failed</h2>

    <p>Joe quoted historian Tim Snyder: "You can tell the health of a democracy based on the health system."</p>

    <p>His argument: Healthcare requires solidarity - the healthy pay for the sick, the young for the old. Without health, you can't be free - too sick to work, participate, exercise liberty. A just health system means society values everyone's <strong>life</strong> fully, not just their survival.</p>

    <p>Then he told the story that crystallized "infrastructure of solidarity."</p>

    <p>Family friend, 16 years old, diagnosed with cancer in his leg.</p>

    <p>Treatment required:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chemotherapy rounds</li>
        <li>Rotation plasty - experimental surgery where they amputate the leg, reverse the remaining portion, and reattach the ankle to function as a knee</li>
        <li>Allows running, full mobility instead of permanent prosthetic</li>
        <li>18-hour surgery</li>
        <li>Only ~12 surgeons worldwide can perform it</li>
        <li>Surgeon had to use his hands to feel for tumors during surgery because MRIs can't detect everything - tumors feel like grains of sand</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cost to the family: $0.</p>

    <p>The father's response: "This is why we pay our taxes. This is who we are."</p>

    <p>Joe called this <strong>"an infrastructure of solidarity."</strong></p>

    <p>Not charity. Not service delivery. <strong>Infrastructure</strong> - solidarity baked into legal, economic, social architecture so it's the default, not the exception.</p>

    <p>Then the devastating turn in his speech:</p>

    <p>"When I look around the world at democratic erosion, I don't see it as failure of the ballot. I see it as reflection of the failure of development. Democratic fragility is the failure of inclusive development."</p>

    <p>J.D. Vance. Brexit. Far-right movements globally rising in supposedly stable democracies.</p>

    <p>Joe's read: These aren't just political phenomena. They're symptoms of development systems that keep people in "not yet dead" status while extracting value, then act surprised when those people embrace authoritarians offering scapegoats.</p>

    <p><strong>The mechanism:</strong></p>

    <p>People aren't stupid. They know they're surviving, not living. They work 11+ hours, service debt, send remittances, live in segregated housing, face discrimination, have no path to citizenship or belonging.</p>

    <p>The system's message: "You're economically productive. You're alive. You haven't died. Mission accomplished."</p>

    <p>But they're not living. They don't have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Dignity in their work</li>
        <li>Time for rest, family, restoration</li>
        <li>Agency over major life decisions</li>
        <li>Belonging in the society they're embedded in</li>
        <li>Realistic path toward dreams beyond survival</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When mainstream politics offers no transformation, demagogues offer false solutions. "Those immigrants took your jobs." "Those elites betrayed you." The real failure - inclusive development that would let everyone truly live - gets masked by racist rhetoric.</p>

    <p>This is how democracies collapse. Not because people are irrational, but because "not yet dead" is unsustainable, and rage finds outlets.</p>

    <p><strong>The health system reveals this</strong> because it's the clearest test of solidarity:</p>

    <p>"Not yet dead" healthcare:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Keep people alive enough to work</li>
        <li>Treat acute crises</li>
        <li>Ignore chronic conditions</li>
        <li>Certainly no experimental 18-hour surgeries for teenagers' mobility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Message: "We'll keep you not dead. That's it."</p>

    <p>"Truly living" healthcare:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Every life has full value</li>
        <li>We'll spend whatever it takes</li>
        <li>Experimental surgery so a 16-year-old can run</li>
        <li>Because that's who we are</li>
        <li>Because your flourishing is our collective commitment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Message: "Your thriving matters. We're in this together."</p>

    <p>A "not yet dead" health system cannot sustain democracy because it fractures the solidarity democracy requires.</p>

    <h2>The Hardest to Reach Are Underserved, Not Unreachable</h2>

    <p>Joe's core insight that changed how I think about everything:</p>

    <p><strong>"The hardest to reach are not hard to reach. They are underserved within the existing system."</strong></p>

    <p>This transformed our framing:</p>

    <p><strong>Old question:</strong> "How do we deliver financial literacy to migrant workers?"</p>

    <p><strong>New question:</strong> "Why don't existing financial tools work for people with recruitment debt, remittance obligations, irregular income, and collectivist family decision-making?"</p>

    <p>We stopped thinking about delivery. We started thinking about systemic barriers.</p>

    <p>Singapore has 1.59 million migrant workers. The system positions them as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Segregated in distant dormitories</li>
        <li>Socially isolated from locals</li>
        <li>Stereotyped as "uneducated outsiders"</li>
        <li>Perceived as "temporary economic contributors" even after 10+ years</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The implicit message: "You're here. You're working. You're generating economic value. You're alive. What more do you want?"</p>

    <p>This is Victorian logic updated: Joe is alive (economically productive), which is to say (let's be clear), he has not yet died (don't confuse productivity with actual living).</p>

    <p>What gets erased:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dreams:</strong> Houses back home, children's education, land - aspirations systematically denied</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> 11+ hour days, 7 days/week for some, segregated housing</li>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> When your choices are "take exploitative job" or "starve back home," you're not choosing</li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Bodies need more than non-death - they need restoration, time with family, play</li>
        <li><strong>Belonging:</strong> "Temporary" status, stereotyped, never integrated even after decades</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The workers weren't hard to reach. Our tools were designed for someone else entirely - someone already living, not someone kept in "not yet dead" status.</p>

    <h2>What Co-Creation Actually Revealed</h2>

    <p>We ran focus groups asking workers to draw their achievements. They drew: houses, children's education, land purchases.</p>

    <p>These weren't abstract aspirations. These were life goals being actively worked toward despite systems designed to prevent them.</p>

    <p>The dream-first framing came directly from this. Workers rejected deficit-based advice ("you're failing to save") because they weren't failing - they were making calculated trade-offs within impossible constraints.</p>

    <p>One worker's reality:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>$600/month income</li>
        <li>$300 remittances (non-negotiable - supporting parents, siblings, maintaining social safety net)</li>
        <li>$300 remaining for food, transport, phone, rent</li>
        <li>Recruitment debt: $8,000 at 15% interest</li>
        <li>Work: 11+ hours daily, 1-2 days off monthly</li>
    </ul>

    <p>ChatGPT's advice when we tested it: "Follow the 50/30/20 rule - save 20%, that's $120/month!"</p>

    <p>The math literally doesn't work. After remittances he has $300 total, not $600. But more fundamentally: the advice assumes individualist frameworks where money is personal, retirement planning exists, and spending is discretionary.</p>

    <p><strong>This is the no ground truth problem playing out.</strong></p>

    <p>Should he reduce remittances to $200 to save $100 monthly toward debt?</p>

    <p>Mathematically: Yes - pays off $8,000 debt faster, reduces interest burden, improves long-term position</p>

    <p>Relationally: No - remittances support sick mother's medical care, younger sibling's school fees, maintain trust that is his only safety net if he gets sick or injured</p>

    <p>There's no algorithmic answer. Only trade-offs embedded in:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Power structures that created recruitment debt systems</li>
        <li>Economic policies that allow 11-hour workdays with minimal protections</li>
        <li>Immigration frameworks that maintain "temporary" status indefinitely</li>
        <li>Social segregation that prevents integration and belonging</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The advice we give either perpetuates "not yet dead" logic (optimize your survival) or recognizes "truly living" aspirations (support your family goals within these constraints).</p>

    <p>We chose the latter. Not because it's algorithmically correct - there is no algorithmic correctness in contexts with no ground truth. But because it honors full humanity.</p>

    <h2>The Gap Between Performance and Impact</h2>

    <p>At SMU, we got:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Spotlight session validation</li>
        <li>Publication opportunities</li>
        <li>Institutional endorsements</li>
        <li>Excellent feedback on co-creation methodology</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We don't have:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Sustained funding beyond research timeline</li>
        <li>Clear maintenance structure once the project "ends"</li>
        <li>Path from "successful prototype" to "tool that actually helps workers long-term"</li>
        <li>Answer to Selvan's question: "Will this exist after research ends?"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The honest answer: Probably not in its current form. It might become a paper. Maybe pilot with an NGO partner. Maybe nothing.</p>

    <p>This is the gap between what gets celebrated academically versus what actually transforms systems. The presentation validated our research. But the real questions - about sustained implementation, about whether co-creation ends when funding ends, about whether we were building infrastructures of solidarity or just performing them - remain unresolved.</p>

    <p>Joe's challenge cuts both ways: We asked questions no one else wanted to ask. We built WITH communities, not FOR them. We discovered insights that pure engineering would never find.</p>

    <p>But if the work ends when institutional support ends, were we really building infrastructure? Or were we doing extractive research with better aesthetics?</p>

    <p>I don't have a good answer yet. But carrying the discomfort matters more than resolving it prematurely.</p>

    <h2>What I'm Carrying Forward</h2>

    <h3>1. Refusing "Not Yet Dead" Logic Everywhere</h3>

    <p>Once you see the Victorian logic, you can't unsee it:</p>

    <p><strong>In development metrics:</strong> Measuring mortality rates, poverty thresholds, coverage percentages - all focused on preventing death rather than enabling flourishing</p>

    <p><strong>In migrant worker systems:</strong> "Economically productive" treated as sufficient success while denying dignity, rest, belonging, paths to citizenship</p>

    <p><strong>In my own life:</strong> Sometimes surviving work rotations rather than thriving, accepting "not yet burned out" as good enough</p>

    <p>I'm learning to reject this entirely:</p>

    <p><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "How do we keep people alive?"<br>
    <strong>Ask:</strong> "What prevents everyone from truly living?"</p>

    <p><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "How do we reach the hard-to-reach?"<br>
    <strong>Ask:</strong> "What systems create 'hard to reach' populations in the first place?"</p>

    <p><strong>Don't ask:</strong> "How do we optimize delivery?"<br>
    <strong>Ask:</strong> "How do we build infrastructures of solidarity?"</p>

    <h3>2. The No Ground Truth Problem Extends Everywhere</h3>

    <p>Financial advice has no ground truth - only trade-offs embedded in power structures.</p>

    <p>This extends far beyond chatbots:</p>

    <p><strong>In my upcoming BTI rotation</strong> (data visualization, trade analytics): When we measure "trade flows," are we measuring value extraction or value creation? Whose prosperity metrics are we optimizing?</p>

    <p><strong>In law school prep for 2027:</strong> Legal frameworks can protect or exploit. Algorithmic justice work isn't about better algorithms - it's interrogating whose interests algorithms serve and who pays the costs.</p>

    <p><strong>In Kura Collective's December event</strong> ("Are We Replacing Friends with AI?"): The question isn't whether AI can simulate friendship. It's whether AI-mediated connection builds solidarity or extracts from it.</p>

    <p>There are no purely technical answers. Every "optimization" contains moral choices about whose flourishing matters.</p>

    <h3>3. Trust Can't Be Engineered, Only Earned</h3>

    <p>The Indigenous vaccine story taught me: You can have perfect logistics and fail completely without trust built through representation, historical reckoning, community leadership.</p>

    <p>For technical work, this means:</p>

    <p><strong>Language design isn't just UX</strong> - proper script versus romanized text signals respect or extraction</p>

    <p><strong>Latency isn't just performance</strong> - under 3 seconds respects that workers' time has value, every second matters when you work 11+ hours</p>

    <p><strong>Questions reveal assumptions</strong> - "What's your income?" centers deficits; "What are you dreaming of?" centers humanity</p>

    <p>You can't shortcut to trust. You earn it through:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Genuine co-creation, not consultation</li>
        <li>Respecting lived expertise over academic frameworks</li>
        <li>Taking time to understand before rushing to solutions</li>
        <li>Acknowledging when your tools don't fit users' realities</li>
        <li>Building WITH rather than FOR</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Infrastructures of Solidarity or Performance?</h3>

    <p>Joe's challenge: "Think about infrastructures of solidarity in every project, policy, technology you touch."</p>

    <p>Infrastructure isn't temporary. Infrastructure persists when enthusiasm fades, when funding ends, when researchers move on.</p>

    <p>If our chatbot work ends with the research grant, we weren't building infrastructure - we were performing co-creation while maintaining extractive academic relationships.</p>

    <p>My 2026 Sovereignty Year framework is attempting personal infrastructure:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>LSAT prep and law school applications → capacity for advocacy work beyond individual cases</li>
        <li>Stepping back from romantic relationships → protecting foundation to show up for community</li>
        <li>Kura Collective organizing → maintaining connections to questions that matter</li>
        <li>Mentorship networks → learning from people who've navigated similar paths</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But I'm still figuring out: How do you build infrastructures of solidarity in temporary positions, term projects, academic research structures designed around extraction?</p>

    <h3>5. Meeting People Who Refuse the Categories</h3>

    <p>That moment coming down the stairs after the conference - our impossibly diverse group that made no institutional sense - felt more important than the validation.</p>

    <p>Because the real work requires refusing categories that make marginalization legible:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>"Hard to reach populations" → systemic exclusion</li>
        <li>"Target demographics" → full humans with agency</li>
        <li>"Service delivery" → co-creation and trust-building</li>
        <li>"Coverage metrics" → solidarity infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm seeking communities that understand this:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Law school cohorts focused on public interest work</li>
        <li>Kura conversations about AI ethics beyond efficiency</li>
        <li>Queer community spaces building mutual aid</li>
        <li>People who know that "70% success" means 30% abandonment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The REACH participants coming down those stairs - we didn't fit boxes. That's the point.</p>

    <h2>What the Conference Actually Was</h2>

    <p>The 2025 REACH conference at SMU wasn't special because of academic validation.</p>

    <p>It was special because:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Students presenting work that makes institutions uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Researchers who understand trust determines success more than technology</li>
        <li>Teams building WITH communities, not optimizing delivery TO them</li>
        <li>People who refuse to accept "not yet dead" as sufficient</li>
        <li>Conversations recognizing marginalized communities hold solutions, not deficits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Joe's closing: "I'm not placing responsibility on your shoulders to fix this. But stay engaged. Stay curious. Think about infrastructures of solidarity in every project, policy, technology."</p>

    <h2>The Unfinished Question</h2>

    <p>Selvan asked: "Will this exist after research ends?"</p>

    <p>I still don't have a good answer. The chatbot might become a paper, might pilot with partners, might vanish.</p>

    <p>But what persists:</p>

    <p><strong>The recognition</strong> that tools asking "What are you dreaming of?" before "What's your income?" honor humanity differently</p>

    <p><strong>The understanding</strong> that personalization for marginalized groups means transforming assumptions, not customizing interfaces</p>

    <p><strong>The knowledge</strong> that there is no ground truth in advice-giving - only trade-offs in power structures we choose to maintain or disrupt</p>

    <p><strong>The refusal</strong> to accept "not yet dead" as sufficient</p>

    <p><strong>The question</strong> Joe left us: Are we building infrastructures of solidarity, or performing them?</p>

    <hr>

    <p>In January I transition to Business Trade Insights at Enterprise Singapore - data visualization, trade analytics, TiVA databases. Technical work with strategic implications and no ground truth in whose prosperity we're measuring.</p>

    <p>In 2026, I'm taking a Sovereignty Year - LSAT prep, personal healing, community building through Kura Collective events exploring what it means to build connection in an age of AI extraction.</p>

    <p>In 2027, I'm aiming for McGill's BCL/JD program, pivoting toward public interest law and algorithmic justice.</p>

    <p>The thread connecting everything: Building bridges between systems and humanity. Between ideas and impact. Between those who inherited maps and those who reverse-engineered them.</p>

    <p>Refusing to optimize "not yet dead" systems. Insisting on infrastructures of solidarity.</p>

    <p>Joe lives.</p>

    <p>Not "which is to say he has not yet died."</p>

    <p>Joe <strong>lives</strong>. Fully. With dignity, agency, dreams, and belonging.</p>

    <p>That's the standard.</p>

    <p>Everything else is Victorian logic in API endpoints.</p>

    <p><em>This reflection draws from REACH Alliance 2025 conference in Singapore, Joseph Wong's opening address on 10 years of REACH, three years researching financial literacy tools for migrant workers, and ongoing questions about what it means to build technology that creates solidarity rather than extracts from it.</em></p>
